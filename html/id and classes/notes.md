## ID and Class in HTML / CSS

* **`id`**

  * `id` is **unique**
  * The same `id` **cannot be used for more than one element**
  * Used when you want to target **one specific element**
  * Represented by **`#`** in CSS

* **`class`**

  * `class` **can be reused**
  * The same class can be applied to **multiple elements**
  * One element can have **multiple classes**
  * Represented by **`.`** in CSS

* **Priority (Specificity)**

  * **`id` has higher preference (specificity) than `class`**
